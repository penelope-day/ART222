<h1> Penelope Day's Portfolio </h1>
<p> Penelope Day's portfolio for ART 222, Digital Art and Design. Rough Draft</p>

<h1>Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>When I am working on a project I often brainstorm a few ideas before I begin making but they are never fully thought out plans. My brainstorming period is primarily ideas of ideas and it is  not until I begin creating that I start to get a sense of what my intention is. The same went for this first project. I knew that I wanted my design to be simple and easily translatable to multiple mediums but I did not know what I wanted it to look like or act like yet. Once I started doodling, the design started coming to life. Workshopping ideas and tinkering with small details is what helps me to make a piece work.</p>
  <p>My logo for the Southworth Planetarium is simple but effective. It gets the point across without much glitz and glamour while still maintaining a fun atmosphere. It is hard for me to reflect on it from an outsider's perspective as I am so deeply embedded in this design now but, I think it would be interesting to see how the different line thicknesses on the bottom of the half-dome affect the design. I agree with Daniel that the original thickness/placement of the line feels off but after tinkering with it I am still unsure of which way looks better. My largest problem with the design is the star in the top left corner. Daniel also mentioned the star in his critique of the work and I agree with him 100%. Possibly by adding a shadow to the star to make it appear as though it is a shooting star going through the half-circle or by adding more prongs to the star it will come together more. Currently, angling the star similarly to the rest of the piece is still creating a strange dissonance in the piece for me. I want to toy with the shadow and prongs and come back to this reflection.</p>

<h1>Project 2 Photo Manipulation</h1>
  <p>I was having a hard time with Photoshop during this project. Not for any technical reasons but because of my own lack of skill in the area. I had the desire to explore an aspect of our world that I have currently been thinking about a lot. With many of my conversations surrounding the future and what career I am going into/what careers my friends want to explore, I have felt a bit sad at the prospect of working everyday with no end in sight. There is the saying ‘If you work a job you enjoy, you never work a day in your life’. This may be true but currently I am having a hard time finding something that I enjoy enough. Through my project, I wanted to explore these feelings that I had surrounding working.
I wanted to explore two sides of the job industry; the blue collar and the white collar. It was important to me that I united these two sides and did not paint one as being ‘better’ than the other. I wanted to show that there is not really ‘winning’ under capitalism. We are all forced to work to be able to provide for our lives and are essentially signing away hours of our lives to be able to ‘live’. By using men as the workers for the second half of the diptych and women as the workers in the first half, I explore themes of sexism in the workspace and beyond. Women are seen as ‘of lesser value’ and therefore they would be the ones doing harder labour while men are ‘smarter’ and would be the ones who would be able to do corporate work. 
The ‘Working Hard’ half of the piece is the one that gave me the most trouble. I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted to portray and how to do it. Even now, I am not as happy with the piece as I would like to be. The woman in the background is placed in front of the railing because I was having a hard time getting her behind it. I would love to spend more time on fixing that specifically. I also think that the message may have gotten a bit abstracted in that piece and I want to workshop with some more images to create a better atmosphere.</p>

<h1>Project 3 Video Editing</h1>
  <p>Premier Pro was by far the hardest program for me to learn so far during this course. I have no experience with video editing and I found the program to be rather complicated. With Illustrator and Photoshop I was pretty much able to figure out how they worked but for some reason I just was not getting the same intuitive experience with Premier Pro. Despite this, I think I was able to get a somewhat decent product out of the program. I would have loved to spend a little more time on learning how to work the program as I still feel as though I do not have a good understanding of it. My inspiration for this work came from more of a feeling than a tangible idea/experience. Trying to translate that feeling into a visual experience was rather hard and I do not think that I accomplished it to the best of my abilities. I think that the dialogue at the end of the video is sending a different message than the one I was trying to get across, blurring the meaning of the work. By altering that last little bit of dialogue to something a bit more centered on everyday life I think that the meaning of the work would be a bit more clear. I like the contrast of the black and white of reality to the warmness of the fantasy of summer in my piece but I would love to play around with the colors a bit more and make it even more apparent that it is an idealized version of events. Overall, I think this is the work that I am most disappointed with during this course, but it is also the piece that I have the most ideas for improvement.</p>

<h1>Project 4 3D Modeling</h1>
  <p>For my project I decided to model a ceramic cat figurine that I got from a friend back in Texas. It reminds me of my time that I spent in Texas and the friends that I made there, especially at the library. This cat represents what I left behind and the life that I used to lead. I had a hard time operating Blender which, I believe, led me to making a less than favourable object. I am disappointed in the way that my figure turned out, mainly because I believe that with a bit more patience and time, I could have created a cat that I was proud of. I encountered my first major problem when I went to sculpt my cat and the tools were not working. I did some researching that led me to believe that my mesh needed more verticies and I tried multiple different ways but could not figure out how to add them. This put a major hole in my plan, as I was planning on relying heavily on the sculpting tools to create the misshappen body of my ceramic cat figure. Once I realized that I was not going to be able to figure out my problem by the due date, I moved on to trying to add color in the hopes that it would make my cat come to life more. I was unable to make that come to fruition as well and finally threw in the towel, submitting the assignment that lies before you today. I am not proud of this cat but I believe that it has the ability to grow and that my skills in 3D modeling are not obsolete as of yet.</p>
