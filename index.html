<h1>Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>When I am working on a project I often brainstorm a few ideas before I begin making but they are never fully thought out plans. My brainstorming period is primarily ideas of ideas and it is  not until I begin creating that I start to get a sense of what my intention is. The same went for this first project. I knew that I wanted my design to be simple and easily translatable to multiple mediums but I did not know what I wanted it to look like or act like yet. Once I started doodling, the design started coming to life. Workshopping ideas and tinkering with small details is what helps me to make a piece work.</p>
  <p>My logo for the Southworth Planetarium is simple but effective. It gets the point across without much glitz and glamour while still maintaining a fun atmosphere. It is hard for me to reflect on it from an outsider's perspective as I am so deeply embedded in this design now but, I think it would be interesting to see how the different line thicknesses on the bottom of the half-dome affect the design. I agree with Daniel that the original thickness/placement of the line feels off but after tinkering with it I am still unsure of which way looks better. My largest problem with the design is the star in the top left corner. Daniel also mentioned the star in his critique of the work and I agree with him 100%. Possibly by adding a shadow to the star to make it appear as though it is a shooting star going through the half-circle or by adding more prongs to the star it will come together more. Currently, angling the star similarly to the rest of the piece is still creating a strange dissonance in the piece for me. I want to toy with the shadow and prongs and come back to this reflection.</p>
